# SFTP on Ubuntu

## Configure sshd

Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file

    Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -f AUTH -l VERBOSE
    Match group sftp
    ChrootDirectory %h
    ForceCommand internal-sftp
    AllowTcpForwarding no
    ForceCommand internal-sftp

Restart OpenSSH:

    service ssh restart

### Modify User Accounts

Remove shell access for sftp user and give `/bin/false` to the user

Add user to the `sftp` group

For ChrootDirectory the 'root' user need to be the owner!

    chown root:root /path/to/homedir

These user will now be unable to create files in their home directories, since these directories are owned by the root user.
Create new directorie for full access.

    cd /path/to/homedir
    mkdir public_html
    chown username:sftp *

Your users should now be able to log into their accounts via SFTP and transfer files to and from their assigned subdirectories, but they shouldnâ€™t be able to see the rest of your filesystem.
