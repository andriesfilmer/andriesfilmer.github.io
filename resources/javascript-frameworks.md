### Framework7 - Vue

Bring components-syntax, structured data and data bindings to Framework7 with power and simplicity of Vue.js

* <http://framework7.io/vue/>

## Backend frameworks
### NodeJs
Node.js® is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
* <http://nodejs.org/>

### Express
Express is an excellent webserver for Node.js that provides routing, middleware, and sessions. Incidentally, the two work quite well together! Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
* <http://expressjs.com/>

## Development tools/frameworks

### Yeoman
Yeoman helps you kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive.
* <http://yeoman.io/>

### Linemanjs
Lineman is a command-line utility that is hyper-focused on helping web developers build first-class JavaScript web applications.
Lineman provides a thin wrapper around a number of client-side productivity tools (primarily Express, '''Grunt''', and Testem), with the goal of helping developers focus on writing awesome web apps instead of worrying about workflow configuration.
* <http://linemanjs.com/>

### Grunt
In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes. After you've configured it, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for you—and your team—with basically zero effort.
* <http://gruntjs.com/>

### Bower
Web sites are made of lots of things — frameworks, libraries, assets, utilities, and rainbows. Bower manages all these things for you.
* <http://bower.io/>

### CoffeScript
CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.
* <http://coffeescript.org/>

### BrowserSync
Time-saving synchronised browser testing
* <http://www.browsersync.io/>

### Compass
Compass is an open-source CSS authoring framework which uses the Sass stylesheet language to make writing stylesheets powerful and easy. If you're not familiar with Sass, Go to [sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com/) to learn all about how it works.
* <http://compass-style.org/>

### SASS
Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
* <http://sass-lang.com/>

## Library's

### jQuery
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
* <http://jquery.com/>

### Modernizr
Modernizr is a small JavaScript library that detects the availability of native implementations for next-generation web technologies, i.e. features that stem from the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications. Many of these features are already implemented in at least one major browser (most of them in two or more), and what Modernizr does is, very simply, tell you whether the current browser has this feature natively implemented or not.
* <http://modernizr.com/>

### Normalize
A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets.  
Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing
<http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/>

### UnderscoreJs
Underscore is a JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects.
* <http://underscorejs.org/>

### RequireJs
RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed and quality of your code.
* <http://requirejs.org/>
