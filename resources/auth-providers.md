## OpenID & OAuth

OpenID is used for logging in and creating accounts on external websites. I don’t want to fill out a registration form or memorize another password to post a comment on a blog post. OpenID allows me to bypass traditional registration and authenticate my identity with login credentials from another website that I’m already registered on, such as Google+ and Facebook. In short, authentication means one website telling another website, “He is who he says he is.”

OAuth goes a bit deeper and is used to grant third-party websites and apps permission to access information on another social network or website. Whenever you sign up for a messaging app, it may ask permission to retrieve your Facebook friends to help you connect with more people. This is often authorized through OAuth. OAuth typically requires authentication prior to authorization, so it’s frequently used in tandem with OpenID. One website tells the other, “He is who he says he is, and here’s the info you asked for.”
