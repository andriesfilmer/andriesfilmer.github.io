## Messengers

I'm don't like to promoot centralized communication service. Things like IRC, XMPP, GNU Social and Diaspora is the way to go in my opinion. You need a public protocol, at least one open source implementation. Otherwise, it's just not worth having. Anyway here is a short list.

### Convos
Convos is the simplest way to use IRC. It is always online, and accessible to your web browser, both on desktop and mobile. Run it on your home server, or cloud service easily.
